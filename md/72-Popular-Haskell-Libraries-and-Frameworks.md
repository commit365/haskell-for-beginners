## Popular Haskell Libraries and Frameworks

Haskell has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that cater to various needs, from web development to data processing. Below is a curated list of some of the most popular and useful libraries and frameworks in the Haskell community.

### 1. Web Development

- **Yesod**: A high-performance web framework that emphasizes type safety and provides a rich set of features for building web applications.
  
- **Servant**: A type-safe web API framework that allows you to define your API using Haskell types, making it easy to create RESTful services.

- **IHP**: A modern web framework that aims to provide a productive environment for web developers, focusing on simplicity and ease of use.

- **Hakyll**: A static site generator that allows you to create websites using Haskell, leveraging the power of Pandoc for content conversion.

### 2. HTTP and Networking

- **http-client**: A low-level HTTP client library for making HTTP requests in Haskell.

- **http-conduit**: A higher-level HTTP client library built on top of `http-client`, providing easy-to-use functions for making requests and handling responses.

- **wreq**: A simple HTTP client library that provides a more user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests.

### 3. Data Processing and Serialization

- **aeson**: A library for JSON parsing and generation, allowing you to easily convert between Haskell data types and JSON.

- **bytestring**: A library for efficient string handling, particularly for binary and text data.

- **lens**: A powerful library for functional programming with optics, enabling easy manipulation of complex data structures.

### 4. Database Interaction

- **persistent**: A type-safe ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Haskell that allows you to interact with databases in a type-safe manner.

- **persistent-postgresql**: A backend for the `persistent` library that provides support for PostgreSQL databases.

- **esqueleto**: A type-safe EDSL (Embedded Domain Specific Language) for constructing SQL queries in Haskell.

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- **HUnit**: A unit testing framework for Haskell that provides a simple way to write and run tests.

- **QuickCheck**: A library for property-based testing, allowing you to define properties that your code should satisfy and automatically generating test cases.

- **tasty**: A flexible testing framework that allows you to write tests using various testing libraries, including HUnit and QuickCheck.

### 6. Concurrency and Parallelism

- **async**: A library for asynchronous programming that provides abstractions for managing concurrent tasks.

- **stm**: Software Transactional Memory library that simplifies concurrent programming by allowing you to compose atomic operations.

- **parallel**: A library that provides strategies for parallel programming, allowing you to easily run computations in parallel.

### 7. Miscellaneous

- **pandoc**: A universal document converter that can convert between various markup formats, including Markdown, LaTeX, and HTML.

- **ShellCheck**: A static analysis tool for shell scripts, helping users write correct and efficient shell scripts.

- **hledger**: A plain-text accounting tool that allows you to track finances using Haskell.

- **Gitit**: A wiki program written in Haskell that uses Git for version control.
