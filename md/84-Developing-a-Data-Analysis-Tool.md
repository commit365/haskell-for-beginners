## Developing a Data Analysis Tool in Haskell

In this guide, we will create a simple data analysis tool that reads a CSV file, performs basic statistical analysis, and outputs the results. This project will help you understand Haskell's capabilities in handling data and performing computations.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Project

1. **Create a New Haskell Project**: If you are using Stack, create a new project:

   ```bash
   stack new data-analysis-tool
   cd data-analysis-tool
   ```

2. **Open the Main File**: Open the `app/Main.hs` file in your favorite text editor.

3. **Add Dependencies**: Open your `package.yaml` file or `.cabal` file and add the following dependencies for handling CSV files and performing numerical computations:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     - cassava    # For CSV parsing
     - statistics  # For statistical calculations
     - text       # For text handling
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   stack build
   ```

### Step 2: Import Necessary Modules

At the top of your `Main.hs` file, import the necessary modules:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Data.Csv (decode, HasHeader(..))
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BL
import qualified Data.Vector as V
import Statistics.Sample (mean, stdDev)
import Control.Monad (forM_)
import Data.Text (Text)
import qualified Data.Text.IO as TIO
```

### Step 3: Define Data Types

Define a data type to represent the data we will analyze. For example, let's assume we are analyzing a dataset with two columns: `Name` and `Score`.

```haskell
-- Define a data type for the CSV data
data Record = Record
    { name  :: Text
    , score :: Double
    } deriving (Show)

-- Instance for CSV decoding
instance FromRecord Record where
    parseRecord v = Record <$> v .! 0 <*> v .! 1
```

### Step 4: Read and Parse the CSV File

Create a function to read and parse the CSV file:

```haskell
-- Function to read CSV file and return records
readCSV :: FilePath -> IO (Either String (V.Vector Record))
readCSV path = do
    csvData <- BL.readFile path
    return $ decode HasHeader csvData
```

### Step 5: Perform Data Analysis

Create functions to perform basic statistical analysis, such as calculating the mean and standard deviation of the scores:

```haskell
-- Function to analyze the records
analyzeRecords :: V.Vector Record -> (Double, Double)
analyzeRecords records =
    let scores = V.toList $ V.map score records
    in (mean scores, stdDev scores)
```

### Step 6: Main Function

Define the main function to tie everything together:

```haskell
-- Main function
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let filePath = "data.csv"  -- Change this to your CSV file path
    result <- readCSV filePath

    case result of
        Left err -> putStrLn $ "Error reading CSV: " ++ err
        Right records -> do
            putStrLn "Data Analysis Results:"
            let (avg, stddev) = analyzeRecords records
            putStrLn $ "Average Score: " ++ show avg
            putStrLn $ "Standard Deviation: " ++ show stddev
```

### Step 7: Preparing Your CSV File

Create a sample CSV file named `data.csv` in the project directory with the following content:

```
Name,Score
Alice,85
Bob,90
Charlie,78
David,88
Eve,92
```

### Step 8: Running the Tool

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run your Haskell application:

   ```bash
   stack run
   ```

2. **View the Results**: The program will read the CSV file and output the average score and standard deviation.

### Example Output

```
Data Analysis Results:
Average Score: 86.6
Standard Deviation: 5.774
```

### Conclusion

You have successfully created a simple data analysis tool in Haskell that reads a CSV file, performs basic statistical analysis, and outputs the results. This project demonstrates Haskell's capabilities in handling data and performing computations.

### Further Enhancements

- **Additional Statistics**: Implement functions to calculate median, mode, or other statistical measures.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrate a library like `Chart` to visualize the data.
- **User Interface**: Create a command-line interface (CLI) to allow users to specify the CSV file and the type of analysis to perform.

### Practice Exercises

1. Extend the tool to handle multiple columns and perform analysis on different data types.
2. Implement error handling for invalid data in the CSV file.
3. Create a function to export the analysis results to a new CSV file.

By completing this project, you have gained practical experience in Haskell programming while creating a useful data analysis tool. Enjoy experimenting with further enhancements!
