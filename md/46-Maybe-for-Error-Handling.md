## Maybe for Error Handling

The `Maybe` type in Haskell is a powerful tool for handling computations that might fail without resorting to exceptions. It provides a way to represent optional values and can be used to indicate success or failure in a type-safe manner.

### Definition of Maybe

The `Maybe` type is defined as follows:

```haskell
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

- `Just a` represents a successful computation that returns a value of type `a`.
- `Nothing` represents a failure or absence of a value.

### Using Maybe for Error Handling

Using `Maybe` for error handling allows you to write functions that can fail without throwing exceptions. Instead, they return `Nothing` when an error occurs.

#### Example: Safe Division

Let's create a function that performs division and uses `Maybe` to handle the case where the divisor is zero.

```haskell
safeDivide :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Float
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing  -- Return Nothing for division by zero
safeDivide x y = Just (fromIntegral x / fromIntegral y)  -- Return the result wrapped in Just
```

### Example Usage

You can use the `safeDivide` function in your main program and handle the `Maybe` result accordingly.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let result1 = safeDivide 10 2
    let result2 = safeDivide 10 0
    
    case result1 of
        Just value -> putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show value  -- Output: Result: 5.0
        Nothing -> putStrLn "Error: Division by zero."
    
    case result2 of
        Just value -> putStrLn $ "Result: " ++ show value
        Nothing -> putStrLn "Error: Division by zero."  -- Output: Error: Division by zero.
```

### Chaining Operations with Maybe

You can chain operations that return `Maybe` using the `>>=` (bind) operator. This allows you to handle failures gracefully without deeply nested case statements.

#### Example with Chaining

Let's create a function that takes two integers, divides them, and then doubles the result.

```haskell
doubleResult :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Float
doubleResult x y = do
    result <- safeDivide x y  -- Perform the division
    return (result * 2)       -- Double the result
```

### Example Usage of Chaining

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let result1 = doubleResult 10 2
    let result2 = doubleResult 10 0
    
    putStrLn $ "Result 1: " ++ show result1  -- Output: Result 1: Just 10.0
    putStrLn $ "Result 2: " ++ show result2  -- Output: Result 2: Nothing
```

### Using Maybe with Lists

You can also use `Maybe` in conjunction with lists to handle cases where a value might not be present.

#### Example: Finding an Element

Let's create a function that finds an element in a list and returns `Maybe`.

```haskell
findElement :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Maybe a
findElement _ [] = Nothing  -- Return Nothing if the list is empty
findElement x xs = if x `elem` xs then Just x else Nothing
```

### Example Usage of Finding an Element

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    let found1 = findElement 3 numbers
    let found2 = findElement 6 numbers

    putStrLn $ "Found 3: " ++ show found1  -- Output: Found 3: Just 3
    putStrLn $ "Found 6: " ++ show found2  -- Output: Found 6: Nothing
```

### Summary

- **Maybe Type**: A type that represents optional values, with `Just` for success and `Nothing` for failure.
- **Error Handling**: Use `Maybe` to handle computations that can fail without throwing exceptions.
- **Chaining Operations**: Use the `>>=` operator or `do` notation to chain operations that return `Maybe`.
- **Combining with Lists**: Use `Maybe` to handle cases where a value might not be present in a list.

### Practice Exercises

1. Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the first even number wrapped in `Maybe`. If there are no even numbers, return `Nothing`.

2. Create a program that reads two integers from the user and uses `safeDivide` to divide them, handling the result with `Maybe`.

3. Implement a function that takes a list of strings and returns the first string that can be converted to an integer, using `Maybe` to handle conversion failures.

### Conclusion

Using the `Maybe` type for error handling in Haskell allows you to write safer and more predictable code. It encourages you to handle potential failures explicitly, improving the robustness of your programs. Practice these concepts to become more comfortable with using `Maybe` for error handling in Haskell!
