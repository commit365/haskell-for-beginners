## Design Patterns in Haskell

Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems in software design. While many design patterns originate from object-oriented programming (OOP), they can also be adapted to functional programming paradigms, particularly in Haskell. This guide will explore some common design patterns in Haskell and how they relate to functional programming concepts.

### 1. Functor Pattern

**Functors** are a fundamental concept in Haskell that allow you to apply a function over wrapped values. The `Functor` type class defines a mapping operation, `fmap`, which applies a function to each element within a context.

#### Example:

```haskell
import Data.Functor

-- Define a simple data type
data Box a = Box a

-- Make Box an instance of Functor
instance Functor Box where
    fmap f (Box x) = Box (f x)

-- Using the Functor
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let box = Box 5
    let newBox = fmap (*2) box
    print newBox  -- Output: Box 10
```

### 2. Monad Pattern

**Monads** are a way to handle computations that include effects, such as state or I/O. The `Monad` type class provides a way to chain operations while managing these effects.

#### Example:

```haskell
import Control.Monad

-- A simple function that uses the Maybe monad
safeDivide :: Double -> Double -> Maybe Double
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing
safeDivide x y = Just (x / y)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let result = do
            x <- safeDivide 10 2
            y <- safeDivide x 5
            return y
    print result  -- Output: Just 1.0
```

### 3. Reader Pattern

The **Reader** pattern is a design pattern that allows you to pass shared configuration or environment data implicitly through your functions. In Haskell, the `Reader` monad provides this functionality.

#### Example:

```haskell
import Control.Monad.Reader

type Config = String

-- A function that uses the Reader monad
greet :: Reader Config String
greet = do
    name <- ask  -- Get the shared configuration
    return $ "Hello, " ++ name

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let config = "Alice"
    let greeting = runReader greet config
    putStrLn greeting  -- Output: Hello, Alice
```

### 4. State Pattern

The **State** pattern is useful for managing stateful computations. In Haskell, you can use the `State` monad to encapsulate stateful computations.

#### Example:

```haskell
import Control.Monad.State

-- A simple stateful computation
increment :: State Int Int
increment = do
    n <- get
    put (n + 1)
    return n

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let initialState = 0
    let (result, finalState) = runState (replicateM 5 increment) initialState
    print result        -- Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
    print finalState    -- Output: 5
```

### 5. Handle Pattern

The **Handle** pattern allows you to manage resources and stateful interactions with external services in a clean way. It separates the interface from the implementation, making it easier to test and maintain.

#### Example:

```haskell
data DatabaseHandle = DatabaseHandle

-- Function to perform a query
queryDatabase :: DatabaseHandle -> String -> IO String
queryDatabase _ query = return $ "Result for: " ++ query

-- Using the Handle pattern
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let handle = DatabaseHandle
    result <- queryDatabase handle "SELECT * FROM users"
    putStrLn result  -- Output: Result for: SELECT * FROM users
```

### Conclusion

Design patterns in Haskell often take on different forms compared to OOP, but they remain valuable for structuring code and managing complexity. By leveraging concepts like functors, monads, and the handle pattern, Haskell programmers can create clean, maintainable, and expressive code.

### Practice Exercises

1. Implement a custom functor and demonstrate its usage in a small application.
2. Create a stateful application using the `State` monad to manage a simple counter.
3. Use the Reader pattern to pass configuration settings through a series of functions.

By understanding and applying these design patterns, you can enhance your Haskell programming skills and write more effective and maintainable code!
